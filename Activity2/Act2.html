<hr>
<p><h4 style="color: white;"><center>Good day! Let's Try THE HTML PRACTICE</center> </h4></p>
<hr>
<h2 style="color: #FFD36E;"><center><u> GOOGLE</h2></u>
	<p style="color: #FFD36E;">I choose Google because Google is generally quicker than the other search engines at bringing back results. It is able to deliver millions of results in 0.19 of a second. This is down to their technical infrastructure, which is much better than the other engines. Google once had a fire at one of their server warehouses and although it destroyed everything hardware-wise, their service wasn’t impacted at all. Nice.Google has a lot more sites in its index. It picks up new sites faster than any other engine, so you are able to search the latest news, latest sites and just loads more sites in general. Technically, you should have a better result if you have more to choose from.</p>

	<h2 style="color: #FFF56D;"><center><u> YOUTUBE</h2></u>
	<p style="color: #FFF56D;">Video is one of the most popular content formats, and it’s regularly shared via social media. Google and other search engines tend to favour video, so sharing video via YouTube with good titles, descriptions and tags is a great way to improve your search engine ranking. Video is a fast and effective way to convey your brand messages. People respond well to visual cues, and video is a perfect method for capturing the emotion and physical attributes of what you’re promoting. Video is a great way to demonstrate concepts that are not easily explained in text form. Show your students through screen capture videos, live demonstration or even drawing on a white board.</p>

	<h2 style="color: #99FFCD;"><center><u> FACEBOOK</h2></u>
	<p style="color: #99FFCD;">Since so many people use Facebook for personal social media, it’s often easier and more familiar than using a website builder or blog. And Facebook is free, whereas there’s a cost involved if you hire a firm, a freelancer, or an employee to build and maintain a business website.  
	The ability to both reduce the time and money cost of digital marketing is, understandably, appealing to many small business owners. Using a Facebook page as both social media tool and business website can make the work of building an online presence simpler, easier, and cheaper.However, while Facebook allows customization of your page header, your store sections, and of course, the content you share, that’s the limit of the branding and personalization you can do on your business page. Your business branding is subordinate to the blue Facebook brand, and your content, including offers, promotions, and updates, must stay within the guidelines established by Facebook.</p>

	<h2 style="color: #9FB4FF;"><center><u> INSTAGRAM</h2></u>
	<p style="color: #9FB4FF;">It shouldn’t come as a surprise that visuals are the best way to communicate and get your message across to people. This is the main reason why marketers prefer using visuals in their social media marketing mix. Instagram wins hands-down when choosing a befitting social platform for such a vivid form of marketing.
	Instagram’s news feed is completely filled with interactive visuals. Using a free Instagram scheduling tool can be pretty handy for timely sharing capabilities without distorting the quality.Audiences today want, rather demand, that brands share authentic stories that resonate well with them.Quite naturally, this compels businesses to embrace storytelling in their conversations with their audiences. And when it comes to storytelling by brands, Instagram is the platform that steals the show.</p>

	<h2 style="color: #8479E1;"><center><u> GMAIL</h2></u>
	<p style="color: #8479E1;">I choose Gmail because first is that you are able to get a great deal of storage space, much more than you may be able to get if you were using a client program for your emails. Currently, Gmail for business offers 25Gb of storage space which means that it is possible to store a large number of email messages or messages containing large files rather than being limited by storage space on a corporate server or hard drive.One that comes instantly to mind is the fact that it can be accessed anywhere where there is internet access. On a server-based email client program you may find that it becomes difficult to access email. Some people find that when they access an online version of their messages they lack the ability to work with them as easily as if they had accessed them from their regular computer.</p>
